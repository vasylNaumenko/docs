# Welcome to DaoSign

DaoSign is a comprehensive solution for managing digital documents and agreements on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a decentralized framework for creating, signing, and verifying digital documents with cryptographic guarantees.

## What is DaoSign?

DaoSign is a blockchain-based platform that enables:

- **Document Templates (Schemas)**: Create reusable document templates with custom data structures
- **Document Instances (Attestations)**: Generate documents based on schemas with filled data
- **Digital Signatures**: Collect and verify signatures from multiple parties
- **Proof of Agreement**: Establish cryptographic proof that all required parties have signed
- **NFT Representation**: Optional tokenization of documents as non-transferable NFTs

## Key Benefits

- **Transparency**: All documents and signatures are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Immutability**: Signed documents cannot be altered without detection
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the document infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Support for various document types and signing policies
- **Verifiable**: Cryptographic proofs ensure authenticity of all signatures
- **Tokenized**: Documents can be represented as NFTs for easier integration with Web3 ecosystems

## Use Cases

DaoSign can be used in various scenarios including:

1. **Legal Agreements**: Contracts, NDAs, employment agreements
2. **Identity Management**: Identity verification, credential attestation
3. **DAO Governance**: Proposals, voting, role assignment
4. **Certification**: Issuing and verifying certificates
5. **Business Processes**: Multi-party workflows and document management
