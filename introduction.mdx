# Welcome to DaoSign

DaoSign is a comprehensive solution for managing digital documents and agreements on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a decentralized framework for creating, signing, and verifying digital documents with cryptographic guarantees.

## What is DaoSign?

DaoSign is a blockchain-based platform that enables:

- **Document Templates (Schemas)**: Create reusable document templates with custom data structures
- **Document Instances (Attestations)**: Generate documents based on schemas with filled data
- **Digital Signatures**: Collect and verify signatures from multiple parties
- **Proof of Agreement**: Establish cryptographic proof that all required parties have signed
- **NFT Representation**: Optional tokenization of documents as non-transferable NFTs
- **Identity Verification**: Verify signatories based on previous attestations

## Key Benefits

- **Transparency**: All documents and signatures are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Immutability**: Signed documents cannot be altered without detection
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the document infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Support for various document types and signing policies
- **Verifiable**: Cryptographic proofs ensure authenticity of all signatures
- **Tokenized**: Documents can be represented as NFTs for easier integration with Web3 ecosystems
- **Composable**: Build complex signature workflows using attestation dependencies

## Use Cases

DaoSign can be used in various scenarios including:

1. **Legal Agreements**: Contracts, NDAs, employment agreements
2. **Identity Management**: Identity verification, credential attestation
3. **DAO Governance**: Proposals, voting, role assignment
4. **Certification**: Issuing and verifying certificates
5. **Business Processes**: Multi-party workflows and document management
6. **Content Moderation**: Attestations for content review and moderation
7. **Electronic Signatures**: Legally compliant e-signature solutions

## Technical Foundation

DaoSign is built on Ethereum-compatible blockchains and leverages smart contracts to provide:

- **Secure Schema Creation**: Define document structures with custom fields
- **Attestation Management**: Create, sign, and verify document instances
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Generate and verify digital signatures
- **NFT Standards**: ERC-721 compliant tokens for document representation
- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, NOT operators for complex signature policies
