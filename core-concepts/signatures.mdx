# Signatures and Proofs

DaoSign uses cryptographic signatures to establish authenticity and consent for documents. Signatures serve as tamper-proof evidence that a specific entity has approved a document.

## Understanding Cryptographic Signatures

In DaoSign, signatures are not mere images of handwritten signatures, but cryptographic proofs created using blockchain wallets. They provide:

- **Authentication**: Proof of the signer's identity (wallet address)
- **Integrity**: Proof that the document has not been altered since signing
- **Non-repudiation**: The signer cannot later deny having signed the document

## Types of Proofs in DaoSign

DaoSign uses two types of proofs:

1. **Proof of Signature (PoS)**: Evidence that a single party has signed an attestation
2. **Proof of Agreement (PoA)**: Collection of all required signatures for an attestation

## Proof of Signature (PoS)

When a signatory signs an attestation, they create a Proof of Signature:

```typescript
interface ProofOfSignature {
  attestation_id: uint256;      // Reference to the attestation
  creator: address;             // Signatory's address
  created_at: uint32;           // Timestamp of signing
  signature: bytes;             // Cryptographic signature
}
```

The signature is created by:
1. Hashing the attestation data
2. Signing the hash with the signatory's private key

This creates a unique signature that:
- Is tied to the specific attestation
- Can only have been created by the owner of that private key
- Would be invalidated by any change to the document

## Proof of Agreement (PoA)

When all required signatures for an attestation are collected, a Proof of Agreement is formed:

```typescript
interface ProofOfAgreement {
  attestation_id: uint256;      // Reference to the attestation
  signatures: bytes[];          // Collection of all signatures
}
```

A Proof of Agreement represents the complete set of approvals required by the attestation's signatories list.

## Signature Verification

Signatures in DaoSign can be verified at any time by:

1. Retrieving the attestation data
2. Computing the expected hash
3. Verifying that the signature was created from that hash using the claimed signer's public key

This verification can be performed by anyone with access to the blockchain data, ensuring transparency and auditability.

## Signature Process

The signature process in DaoSign works as follows:

1. **Attestation Creation**: 
   - The creator generates an attestation
   - The creator signs the attestation with their private key
   - The attestation is stored on the blockchain

2. **Signature Collection**:
   - Each required signatory reviews the attestation
   - Each signatory signs using their private key
   - Each signature (PoS) is stored on the blockchain

3. **Agreement Formation**:
   - When all required signatures are collected
   - The system automatically creates a Proof of Agreement
   - If configured, an NFT representing the agreement may be minted

## Signing an Attestation

To sign an attestation:

```javascript
// Connect with the signatory's wallet
await daoSign.connect(signatoryWallet);

// Sign the attestation
await daoSign.signAttestation(attestationId);
```

## Checking Signature Status

You can check the status of signatures for an attestation:

```javascript
// Get all proofs of signature for an attestation
const signatures = await daoSign.getProofsOfSignature(attestationId);

// Check if a specific address has signed
const hasSigned = signatures.some(sig => sig.creator === address);

// Check if all required signatories have signed
const attestation = await daoSign.getAttestation(attestationId);
const allSigned = attestation.signatories.length === signatures.length;

// Get the proof of agreement (if complete)
const agreements = await daoSign.getProofsOfAgreement(attestationId);
const isComplete = agreements.length > 0;
```

## Signature Policy Requirements

DaoSign allows schemas to define signatory policies that must be satisfied before a party can sign an attestation. These policies can require signatories to have previous attestations from specific schemas.

For example, a policy might require:
- AND: The signatory must have attestations from schemas A, B, and C
- OR: The signatory must have an attestation from at least one of schemas X, Y, or Z
- NOT: The signatory must not have attestations from schema P

```javascript
// Example of signatory policy requiring employment verification
const signatoryPolicy = {
  operator: "0x01", // AND
  signatory_description: "Must be a verified employee",
  required_schema_id: [42] // Schema ID for "Employment Verification"
};
```

## Signature Security Best Practices

- **Private key security**: Never share private keys or seed phrases
- **Review before signing**: Always review attestation content before signing
- **Use hardware wallets**: Consider using hardware wallets for enhanced security
- **Consider multi-sig**: For high-value documents, consider multi-signature wallets
- **Verify counter-parties**: Confirm the identity of other signatories before signing
- **Check schema details**: Verify the schema properties including revocation policy
