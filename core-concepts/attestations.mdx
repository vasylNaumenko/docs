# Attestations

Attestations are concrete instances of schemas with filled data. They represent actual documents that can be signed and verified on the blockchain.

## What is an Attestation?

An attestation is a specific document created from a schema template. It includes:

- **Document Data**: Values for each field defined in the schema
- **Creator**: The entity that created the document
- **Recipient**: The entity the document is addressed to
- **Signatories**: Entities required to sign the document
- **Signatures**: Cryptographic proofs of approval

## Attestation Structure

An attestation in DaoSign consists of several key components:

### Attestation Data

```typescript
interface Attestation {
  attestation_id: uint256;      // Unique identifier
  schema_id: uint256;           // Reference to the schema it's based on
  attestation_result: AttestationResult[]; // Data fields with values
  creator: address;             // Creator's wallet address
  recipient: address;           // Recipient's wallet address
  created_at: uint32;           // Creation timestamp
  signatories: address[];       // List of addresses required to sign
  signature: bytes;             // Creator's signature
}
```

### Attestation Result

Each field in an attestation contains:

```typescript
interface AttestationResult {
  attestation_result_type: string; // Data type matching schema definition
  name: string;                    // Field name matching schema definition
  value: bytes;                    // The actual data value
}
```

## Internal Attestation

Once stored on the blockchain, an attestation is extended with additional properties:

```typescript
interface InternalAttestation {
  // All properties from Attestation, plus:
  is_revoked: boolean;          // Whether the attestation has been revoked
  revoked_at: uint32;           // Timestamp of revocation (if applicable)
  revoke_signature: bytes;      // Signature for revocation (if applicable)
}
```

## Attestation Lifecycle

Attestations follow a lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: An attestation is created from a schema with filled data
2. **Signing**: Required signatories provide their signatures
3. **Agreement**: When all signatures are collected, a Proof of Agreement is formed
4. **Tokenization**: Optionally, the attestation can be represented as an NFT
5. **Revocation**: If allowed by the schema, the attestation can be revoked

## Proof of Signature (PoS)

When a signatory signs an attestation, a Proof of Signature is created:

```typescript
interface ProofOfSignature {
  attestation_id: uint256;      // Reference to the attestation
  creator: address;             // Signatory's address
  created_at: uint32;           // Timestamp of signing
  signature: bytes;             // Cryptographic signature
}
```

## Proof of Agreement (PoA)

When all required signatures are collected, a Proof of Agreement is formed:

```typescript
interface ProofOfAgreement {
  attestation_id: uint256;      // Reference to the attestation
  signatures: bytes[];          // Collection of all signatures
}
```

## Creating an Attestation

To create an attestation:

1. Select a schema to base the attestation on
2. Fill in data for all fields defined in the schema
3. Specify the recipient and required signatories
4. Submit the attestation to the blockchain

Example:
```javascript
const loanAgreement = {
  schema_id: 123, // ID of a loan agreement schema
  attestation_result: [
    {
      attestation_result_type: "string",
      name: "Lender Name",
      value: "First National Bank"
    },
    {
      attestation_result_type: "string",
      name: "Borrower Name",
      value: "Jane Smith"
    },
    {
      attestation_result_type: "uint256",
      name: "Loan Amount",
      value: "50000"
    },
    {
      attestation_result_type: "uint256",
      name: "Interest Rate",
      value: "5"
    },
    {
      attestation_result_type: "uint256",
      name: "Term in Months",
      value: "60"
    }
  ],
  recipient: "0xabcd...", // Borrower's address
  signatories: ["0x1234...", "0xabcd..."] // Lender and borrower addresses
};

// Create the attestation on blockchain
const attestationId = await daoSign.createAttestation(loanAgreement);
```

## Signing an Attestation

Each required signatory must sign the attestation:

```javascript
// Connect with the signatory's wallet
await daoSign.connect(signatoryWallet);

// Sign the attestation
await daoSign.signAttestation(attestationId);
```

## Revoking an Attestation

If allowed by the schema, the creator can revoke an attestation:

```javascript
// Only the creator can revoke
await daoSign.connect(creatorWallet);

// Revoke the attestation
await daoSign.revokeAttestation(attestationId);
```

## Attestation Best Practices

- **Verify data**: Double-check all data before creating attestations
- **Clear signatories**: Make sure all required signatories are clearly identified
- **Explain process**: Ensure signatories understand what they're signing
- **Consider privacy**: Be cautious about including sensitive data
- **Plan for revocation**: Consider whether attestations should be revocable
- **Backup data**: While attestations are on-chain, maintain off-chain backups of critical documents
