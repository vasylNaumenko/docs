# Schemas

Schemas are the foundation of the DaoSign protocol, serving as templates for creating documents with predefined structures. They define the data fields, signing requirements, and lifecycle options for documents.

## What is a Schema?

A schema is a blueprint that defines:

- **Structure**: What fields and data types a document contains
- **Metadata**: Information about the document template itself
- **Signing Policies**: Rules about who can sign the document
- **Lifecycle Rules**: Expiration, revocation, and other document behavior

## Schema Structure

A schema in DaoSign consists of several key components:

### Schema Metadata

The metadata provides general information about the schema:

```typescript
interface SchemaMetadata {
  name: string;                // Name of the schema
  description: string;         // Description of the schema 
  attestation_type: string;    // Type (e.g., "agreement", "identity", "authority")
  nft_name: string;            // Name for NFT collection (if enabled)
  nft_symbol: string;          // Symbol for NFT collection (if enabled)
  creator: address;            // Creator's wallet address
  created_at: uint32;          // Creation timestamp
  is_nft: boolean;             // Whether attestations can be tokenized as NFTs
  is_public: boolean;          // Whether anyone can create attestations from this schema
  is_revokable: boolean;       // Whether attestations can be revoked
  expire_in: uint32;           // Expiration period in seconds (0 for never)
}
```

### Schema Definition

The definition specifies the fields and data types for the document:

```typescript
interface SchemaDefinition {
  definition_type: string;     // Data type of the field (string, boolean, uint256, etc.)
  definition_name: string;     // Name of the field
}
```

DaoSign supports the following data types:
- `string`: Text data
- `boolean`: True/false values
- `uint256`: Unsigned integers
- `bytes`: Raw binary data
- `bytes32`: Fixed-length binary data
- `address`: Ethereum addresses

### Signatory Policy

The signatory policy defines the rules for who can sign attestations:

```typescript
interface SignatoryPolicy {
  operator: bytes1;            // Logical operator (AND, OR, NOT)
  signatory_description: string; // Description of the policy
  required_schema_id: uint256[]; // Schema IDs that signatories must have attestations for
}
```

The policy can use logical operators to combine requirements:
- `0x01`: AND - Signatory must have attestations for ALL required schemas
- `0x02`: OR - Signatory must have attestations for AT LEAST ONE required schema
- `0x03`: NOT - Signatory must NOT have attestations for ANY required schema

## Schema Privacy and Access

Schemas can be:

- **Public**: Anyone can create attestations based on the schema
- **Private**: Only the schema creator can create attestations

## Schema Lifecycle

Schemas may include lifecycle rules:

- **Expiration**: Schemas can have an expiration period after which new attestations cannot be created
- **Tokenization**: Schemas can be configured to generate NFTs for attestations

## Creating a Schema

To create a schema, you need to:

1. Define the schema structure with fields and data types
2. Set metadata including name, description, and options
3. Define any signatory policies
4. Submit the schema to the blockchain

Example:
```javascript
const employmentAgreement = {
  metadata: {
    name: "Employment Agreement",
    description: "Standard employment contract",
    attestation_type: "agreement",
    is_public: true,
    is_revokable: true,
    expire_in: 0, // Never expires
    is_nft: true,
    nft_name: "Employment Contract",
    nft_symbol: "EMPC"
  },
  schema_definition: [
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Employer Name" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Employee Name" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Start Date" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Salary" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Position" }
  ],
  signatory_policy: []
};

// Create the schema on blockchain
const schemaId = await daoSign.createSchema(employmentAgreement);
```

## Schema Best Practices

- **Keep it simple**: Only include fields that are necessary
- **Use descriptive names**: Field names should be clear and self-explanatory
- **Consider privacy**: Don't include sensitive data directly in schemas
- **Plan for evolution**: Consider how your schema might need to change over time
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate your schema with test attestations before wider use
