# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is DaoSign?

DaoSign is a blockchain-based protocol for creating, signing, and verifying digital documents. It provides a flexible framework for document templates (schemas), document instances (attestations), and cryptographic signatures on the Ethereum blockchain.

### How is DaoSign different from traditional e-signature solutions?

Traditional e-signature solutions rely on centralized providers to validate and store signatures. DaoSign, in contrast, leverages blockchain technology to provide:

- **Decentralization**: No single authority controls the infrastructure
- **Immutability**: Signed documents can't be altered without detection
- **Transparency**: All signatures are publicly verifiable
- **Composability**: Documents can reference and build upon each other
- **Tokenization**: Documents can be represented as NFTs

### Who owns DaoSign documents and signatures?

Documents and signatures in DaoSign exist on the public blockchain and are therefore visible to anyone with access to the blockchain. However, the control of these documents (ability to sign, revoke, etc.) is governed by the cryptographic keys of authorized parties.

## Technical Questions

### What blockchains does DaoSign support?

DaoSign is primarily designed for Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible blockchains (like Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.). The core contracts can be deployed on any EVM-compatible chain.

### Are DaoSign documents stored on the blockchain?

DaoSign stores document structure, metadata, and signatures on the blockchain. For efficiency and privacy, the actual document content is typically represented as a structured set of fields with values or as hashes that reference content stored off-chain.

### Can DaoSign documents be private?

While all blockchain transactions are publicly visible, DaoSign supports privacy patterns:
- Storing only hashes on-chain with the content kept private off-chain
- Encrypting sensitive fields before storing them
- Using access control mechanisms for viewing complete document content

### How secure are DaoSign signatures?

DaoSign signatures use the same cryptographic primitives as blockchain transactions themselves. They are created using private keys and can be verified using public keys, providing a high level of security when private keys are properly protected.

## Usage Questions

### What types of documents can I create with DaoSign?

DaoSign is flexible and can support various document types, including:
- Legal agreements (contracts, NDAs, etc.)
- Certificates and credentials
- Governance proposals and voting
- Identity documents
- Licenses and permits
- Content moderation attestations

### How do I verify a DaoSign document?

You can verify a DaoSign document by:
1. Retrieving the attestation from the blockchain using its ID
2. Checking that all required signatures are present and valid
3. Verifying that the attestation hasn't been revoked
4. If it's represented as an NFT, checking the token ownership

### Can DaoSign documents expire?

Yes, schemas in DaoSign can specify an expiration period (`expire_in` field in schema metadata). After this period:
- No new attestations can be created from the schema
- Existing attestations remain valid unless explicitly revoked

### Can I revoke a signature or document?

Yes, if the schema is configured to allow revocation (`is_revokable = true` in schema metadata), the creator of an attestation can revoke it. This operation is recorded on the blockchain and renders the attestation invalid.

## NFT Questions

### How do NFTs work in DaoSign?

When a schema has NFT support enabled (`is_nft = true`), DaoSign deploys an ERC-721 token collection specific to that schema. Attestations can then be represented as NFTs, with:
- Token ID = Attestation ID
- Token ownership representing attestation ownership
- Token metadata reflecting attestation data

### Who owns the NFT for a multi-signature document?

For documents requiring multiple signatures, the NFT is minted to the DaoSign contract itself once all required signatures are collected. This ensures that no single party controls the NFT, while still providing a tokenized representation of the completed agreement.

### Can I transfer DaoSign NFTs?

This depends on the implementation. By default, DaoSign NFTs follow the standard ERC-721 transfer mechanisms, but custom implementations can restrict transfers to preserve the binding relationship between the document and the original parties.

## Integration Questions

### How can I integrate DaoSign with my application?

You can integrate DaoSign through:
1. **Direct Contract Interaction**: Using web3 libraries like ethers.js or web3.js to interact with the smart contracts
2. **DaoSign Client Library**: Using our JavaScript client library for simplified integration
3. **API Integration**: Building on our API for applications that need server-side integration

### Can I use DaoSign with my existing identity system?

Yes, DaoSign can work with various identity systems:
- Blockchain wallet addresses serve as basic identities
- The signatory policy feature can enforce requirements for specific identity attestations
- Integration with external identity providers is possible through appropriate schemas and verification

### Does DaoSign support legal compliance for e-signatures?

DaoSign provides the technical infrastructure for cryptographic signatures. For legal compliance (like eIDAS in Europe or ESIGN in the US), additional implementation considerations are needed:
- Capturing user intent and consent
- Recording metadata about signing conditions
- Establishing reliable timestamp services
- Implementing appropriate access controls

## Developer Questions

### How do I contribute to DaoSign?

DaoSign is an open platform and welcomes contributions. You can:
- Review and contribute to the core contracts
- Build client libraries in different languages
- Create applications that integrate with DaoSign
- Develop new schema types and use cases

### Where can I get support?

For developer support:
- Check the documentation at [docs.daosign.xyz](https://docs.daosign.xyz)
- Join our developer community
- Open issues for specific technical questions
- Reach out to the core team at support@daosign.xyz

### What are the gas costs for using DaoSign?

Gas costs vary depending on:
- The complexity of the schema (number of fields and policies)
- The number of signatories required
- Whether NFT tokenization is used
- The current gas prices on the chosen network

For cost optimization, consider using Layer 2 solutions or sidechains with lower gas fees.
