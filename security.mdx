# Security Best Practices

Implementing DaoSign securely requires careful consideration of various factors. This document outlines best practices for maintaining security throughout the document lifecycle.

## Key Management

### Private Key Security

Private keys are the foundation of security in DaoSign as they're used to create and verify signatures.

**Best Practices:**
- **Hardware Wallets**: Use hardware wallets for high-value operations
- **Never Share**: Never share private keys or seed phrases
- **Secure Storage**: Use proper key management solutions, not plaintext storage
- **Minimize Exposure**: Limit private key usage to necessary operations
- **Regular Rotation**: Consider rotating keys for long-term security

### Multi-Signature Wallets

For enhanced security, especially in organizational contexts:

**Best Practices:**
- **Use Multisig**: Implement multi-signature wallets for critical operations
- **Threshold Signatures**: Configure appropriate signature thresholds (e.g., 2-of-3 or 3-of-5)
- **Distributed Control**: Assign keys to different stakeholders or departments
- **Recovery Planning**: Establish clear recovery procedures for lost keys

## Schema Design Security

### Schema Definition

The schema forms the foundation of your documents. Secure schema design is essential:

**Best Practices:**
- **Minimal Fields**: Only include necessary fields to minimize attack surface
- **Correct Data Types**: Use appropriate data types for each field
- **Field Validation**: Define validation requirements for each field
- **Privacy Considerations**: Avoid storing sensitive data directly in fields
- **Expiration Settings**: Configure appropriate expiration periods for time-sensitive schemas

### Signatory Policies

Signatory policies control who can sign attestations:

**Best Practices:**
- **Least Privilege**: Grant signing privileges only to necessary parties
- **Role-Based Policies**: Define policies based on roles rather than specific addresses
- **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple signatory requirements for critical documents
- **Policy Testing**: Thoroughly test policies before deployment

## Attestation Security

### Data Validation

Ensuring data integrity in attestations:

**Best Practices:**
- **Input Validation**: Validate all data before creating attestations
- **Schema Compliance**: Ensure all fields match the schema requirements
- **Consistent Formats**: Use standardized formats for dates, addresses, etc.
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Remove any potentially harmful data

### Signature Process

Secure signature processes protect against unauthorized approvals:

**Best Practices:**
- **Clear Intent**: Ensure signatories understand what they're signing
- **Verification Steps**: Implement explicit verification before signing
- **Signature Confirmation**: Provide clear confirmation of signature success
- **Metadata Capture**: Record relevant metadata (time, device, location) with signatures

## Revocation Management

### Controlled Revocation

Proper revocation controls prevent abuse:

**Best Practices:**
- **Limited Authority**: Restrict revocation to authorized parties
- **Revocation Reasons**: Implement structured reason codes for revocations
- **Revocation Notifications**: Notify all affected parties of revocations
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain a clear audit trail of revocation events

### Expiration Handling

Managing document expiration securely:

**Best Practices:**
- **Clear Expiration**: Make expiration dates explicit to all parties
- **Renewal Process**: Establish a clear process for renewal of expired documents
- **Expired Document Handling**: Define how expired documents should be treated
- **Automatic Notifications**: Set up notifications before expiration

## Integration Security

### Client Applications

Secure integration in client applications:

**Best Practices:**
- **Library Validation**: Use validated and up-to-date client libraries
- **Secure Connections**: Implement HTTPS for all API connections
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without revealing sensitive information
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Event Monitoring**: Monitor events for unexpected activities

### Smart Contract Interaction

Secure interaction with DaoSign contracts:

**Best Practices:**
- **Gas Limits**: Set appropriate gas limits for transactions
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor transactions for completion and success
- **Nonce Management**: Implement proper nonce management for transactions
- **Revert Handling**: Handle transaction reverts gracefully

## Privacy Considerations

### On-Chain Data

Manage on-chain data with privacy in mind:

**Best Practices:**
- **Minimal On-Chain Data**: Store only necessary data on-chain
- **Hash-Based References**: Use hashes to reference off-chain sensitive data
- **Avoid PII**: Never store personally identifiable information directly on-chain
- **Encrypted Fields**: Consider encrypting sensitive fields before storing

### Off-Chain Storage

Secure complementary off-chain storage:

**Best Practices:**
- **Encrypted Storage**: Encrypt sensitive off-chain data
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for off-chain data
- **Data Mapping**: Maintain secure mapping between on-chain and off-chain data
- **Backup Procedures**: Establish regular backup procedures for off-chain data

## Audit and Compliance

### Audit Trails

Maintain comprehensive audit trails:

**Best Practices:**
- **Event Logging**: Log all significant events (creation, signing, revocation)
- **Tamper-Proof Logs**: Ensure logs cannot be modified
- **Access Logging**: Track who accessed documents and when
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of your implementation

### Regulatory Compliance

Ensure compliance with applicable regulations:

**Best Practices:**
- **Jurisdiction Awareness**: Understand the regulations in all relevant jurisdictions
- **eSignature Laws**: Ensure compliance with electronic signature laws (ESIGN, eIDAS, etc.)
- **Data Protection**: Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Record Retention**: Implement appropriate record retention policies

## Deployment Security

### Contract Deployment

Secure deployment of DaoSign contracts:

**Best Practices:**
- **Audited Code**: Use audited contract code for production
- **Test Networks**: Test thoroughly on test networks before mainnet deployment
- **Upgradeability Considerations**: Understand the security implications of upgradeability
- **Owner Controls**: Implement secure processes for contract ownership

### User Onboarding

Secure user onboarding processes:

**Best Practices:**
- **Identity Verification**: Implement appropriate identity verification for signatories
- **Role Assignment**: Securely assign roles and permissions
- **Training**: Provide security training for users
- **Clear Documentation**: Document security features and responsibilities

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling

Prepare for potential security incidents:

**Best Practices:**
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a plan for responding to security incidents
- **Key Compromise Procedures**: Define procedures for suspected key compromise
- **Communication Plan**: Establish clear communication channels for incidents
- **Regular Drills**: Conduct regular security incident drills

### Recovery Procedures

Establish recovery procedures:

**Best Practices:**
- **Backup Procedures**: Maintain regular backups of all critical data
- **Key Recovery**: Document key recovery processes
- **Service Continuity**: Plan for maintaining service during incidents
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Conduct thorough analysis after any incident
