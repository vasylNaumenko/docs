# Security Considerations

This document outlines important security considerations when implementing and using DaoSign. Following these guidelines will help ensure your document signing processes remain secure and reliable.

## Smart Contract Security

### Audited Code

The DaoSign contracts have undergone security review, but as with any blockchain application:

- Always use the latest audited version of the contracts
- Check for security announcements before significant integrations
- Consider additional audits for critical implementations
- Be aware that no code is entirely immune to vulnerabilities

### Proxy Implementation

DaoSign uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern:

- The proxy pattern allows for contract upgrades while preserving state
- Upgrades can only be performed by the contract owner
- Verify the ownership of proxy contracts before integrating
- Monitor upgrade events to stay aware of implementation changes

### Input Validation

DaoSign performs extensive validation, but your application should:

- Validate all inputs before sending transactions
- Verify schema definitions match your intended document structure
- Check signatory lists for correctness before creating attestations
- Validate data types to avoid unexpected conversion issues

## Key Management

### Private Key Security

The security of signatures depends entirely on private key security:

- Use hardware wallets for high-value signing operations
- Never store private keys in client-side code or localStorage
- Consider multi-signature setups for organizational wallets
- Implement proper key rotation procedures for long-term security

### Organizational Controls

For organizational use of DaoSign:

- Use multi-signature wallets for creating critical schemas
- Implement approval workflows before signing important documents
- Consider custody solutions designed for organizational use
- Document key recovery procedures for business continuity

### Key Compromise Response

If a private key is compromised:

1. Revoke any attestations created by that key (if revocable)
2. Create new attestations with a secure key if needed
3. Notify all affected parties
4. Create a clear audit trail of the incident and response

## Data Privacy

### On-Chain Data Considerations

Remember that blockchain data is public:

- Never put sensitive personal data directly on-chain
- Use hashing or encryption for sensitive information
- Consider legal compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) when designing schemas
- Be mindful of metadata that could leak sensitive information

### Hash-and-Store Pattern

For sensitive documents:

1. Store the complete document off-chain in a secure system
2. Hash the document content with a secure algorithm (SHA-256)
3. Store only the hash on-chain in the attestation
4. Implement secure off-chain storage with access controls

```javascript
// Example of hash-and-store pattern
async function createSecureAttestation(document, schema) {
  // Hash the sensitive document
  const documentHash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', new TextEncoder().encode(document));
  const hashHex = Array.from(new Uint8Array(documentHash))
    .map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0'))
    .join('');
  
  // Store document off-chain with access controls
  const documentId = await secureStorage.store(document, {
    access_control: getAccessControlList()
  });
  
  // Create attestation with hash and reference
  const attestation = {
    schema_id: schema.id,
    attestation_result: [
      {
        attestation_result_type: "string",
        name: "Document Title",
        value: document.title
      },
      {
        attestation_result_type: "bytes32",
        name: "Document Hash",
        value: `0x${hashHex}`
      },
      {
        attestation_result_type: "string",
        name: "Document Reference",
        value: documentId
      }
    ],
    recipient: document.recipientAddress,
    signatories: document.signatoryAddresses
  };
  
  return attestation;
}
```

### Encrypted Fields

For fields that should be visible only to authorized parties:

1. Encrypt the sensitive data using the recipients' public keys
2. Store the encrypted data on-chain
3. Allow decryption only by authorized parties with the correct private keys

```javascript
// Example of encrypted field implementation
async function encryptField(value, recipientPublicKeys) {
  // Create a new random symmetric key
  const symmetricKey = await generateRandomSymmetricKey();
  
  // Encrypt the value with the symmetric key
  const encryptedValue = await encryptWithSymmetricKey(value, symmetricKey);
  
  // Encrypt the symmetric key with each recipient's public key
  const encryptedKeys = await Promise.all(
    recipientPublicKeys.map(async (publicKey) => {
      return {
        recipient: publicKey.id,
        encryptedKey: await encryptWithPublicKey(symmetricKey, publicKey.key)
      };
    })
  );
  
  // Return the encrypted data structure
  return {
    encryptedValue,
    encryptedKeys
  };
}
```

## Signature Verification

### Signature Validation

Always perform thorough signature validation:

- Verify the cryptographic integrity of signatures
- Confirm the signatory was authorized to sign
- Check that the attestation was not revoked
- Verify the attestation matches the expected schema

```javascript
// Example signature verification
async function verifySignature(attestationId, signature, signerAddress) {
  // Create the expected message hash
  const messageHash = ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(
    ['uint256'],
    [attestationId]
  );
  
  // Recover the signer's address from the signature
  const messageHashBytes = ethers.utils.arrayify(messageHash);
  const recoveredAddress = ethers.utils.verifyMessage(messageHashBytes, signature);
  
  // Compare with the claimed signer
  if (recoveredAddress.toLowerCase() !== signerAddress.toLowerCase()) {
    throw new Error('Invalid signature: signer mismatch');
  }
  
  // Check if attestation is revoked
  const attestation = await daoSign.getAttestation(attestationId);
  if (attestation.is_revoked) {
    throw new Error('Attestation has been revoked');
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### Timestamp Verification

Consider that blockchain timestamps have limitations:

- Block timestamps can vary slightly from real time
- Miners have some flexibility in setting timestamps
- For time-critical operations, consider using additional timestamp oracles
- Always allow reasonable time buffers for expiration checks

## Integration Security

### Frontend Security

When building user interfaces for DaoSign:

- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper authentication for user actions
- Clearly display what users are signing before requesting signatures
- Add confirmation steps for high-value or irreversible operations

### Backend Integration

For server-side integrations:

- Use secure key management systems (KMS, HSM) for any server-side signing
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Log all signing operations for audit purposes
- Implement role-based access control for signing operations
- Consider using secure enclaves for cryptographic operations

### Wallet Connection Security

When connecting to user wallets:

- Use established wallet connection libraries (e.g., Web3Modal, WalletConnect)
- Always display a clear message about what the user is signing
- Verify the connected address matches the expected signer
- Implement session timeouts for wallet connections
- Include transaction details in signature requests

## Transaction Security

### Gas Considerations

Be aware of gas-related security considerations:

- Set appropriate gas limits to prevent transaction failures
- Be prepared for gas price fluctuations
- Implement retry mechanisms with increasing gas prices for critical transactions
- Consider using gas price oracles for optimal pricing

### Front-Running Protection

Be aware of potential front-running attacks:

- Critical operations may be vulnerable to transaction ordering manipulation
- Consider using commit-reveal patterns for sensitive operations
- Implement gas price strategies that reduce front-running risk
- Be aware that revocation operations could potentially be front-run

## Monitoring and Response

### Event Monitoring

Set up monitoring for key contract events:

```javascript
// Example monitoring setup
function setupEventMonitoring(daoSignContract, alertSystem) {
  // Monitor for schema creation
  daoSignContract.on('SchemaCreated', (schemaId, event) => {
    logEvent('Schema created', { schemaId });
  });
  
  // Monitor for attestation creation
  daoSignContract.on('AttestationCreated', (attestationId, event) => {
    logEvent('Attestation created', { attestationId });
  });
  
  // Monitor for revocations (critical to track)
  daoSignContract.on('Revoked', (attestationId, event) => {
    logEvent('Attestation revoked', { attestationId });
    alertSystem.sendAlert('REVOCATION', `Attestation ${attestationId} has been revoked`);
  });
  
  // Monitor for contract upgrades
  daoSignContract.on('ContractUpgraded', (newVersion, timestamp, event) => {
    logEvent('Contract upgraded', { newVersion, timestamp });
    alertSystem.sendAlert('UPGRADE', `Contract upgraded to version ${newVersion}`);
  });
}
```

### Security Incident Response

Develop a plan for responding to security incidents:

1. **Detection**: Set up monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities
2. **Containment**: Have procedures to limit damage (e.g., revoking compromised attestations)
3. **Eradication**: Address the root cause of security issues
4. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations after an incident
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures based on incident findings

### Regular Auditing

Implement regular security audits:

- Review access controls and permissions
- Check for unused or outdated schemas
- Verify all integrations are using current contract versions
- Test revocation procedures regularly
- Perform penetration testing on your integration

## Compliance Considerations

### Legal Requirements

Consider legal and regulatory requirements:

- Ensure your implementation meets e-signature legal requirements in your jurisdiction
- Consider data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement appropriate data retention and deletion policies
- Document compliance measures for audit purposes

### Industry-Specific Compliance

Different industries have specific compliance requirements:

- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance for patient data
- **Finance**: KYC/AML regulations, financial record-keeping requirements
- **Government**: Additional security requirements for government contracts
- **Education**: FERPA compliance for student records
