# DaoSign Use Cases

DaoSign's blockchain-based document signing and verification platform can be applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. This document outlines some of the primary use cases to help you understand how DaoSign can be implemented in different contexts.

## Legal Agreements

### Smart Contracts with Legal Backing

**Challenge:** Organizations need legally binding agreements that are also programmable and transparent.

**Solution:** DaoSign enables the creation of legal agreements that exist both as traditional legal documents and as on-chain attestations. This provides:

- Legally enforceable contracts with cryptographic proof of signing
- Immutable record of agreement terms and signatures
- Automatic execution of certain terms through smart contract integration
- Transparent verification of document authenticity

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
// Creating a legal agreement schema
const legalAgreementSchema = {
  metadata: {
    name: "Service Agreement",
    description: "Legally binding service contract",
    attestation_type: "agreement",
    is_nft: true,
    is_public: false,
    is_revokable: true,
    expire_in: 63072000, // 2 years
    nft_name: "Legal Contract",
    nft_symbol: "LEGAL"
  },
  schema_definition: [
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Party A Legal Name" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Party B Legal Name" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Jurisdiction" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Governing Law" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Service Description" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Effective Date" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Term Length (days)" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Payment Amount" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Payment Terms" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Termination Conditions" }
  ],
  signatory_policy: []
};
```

### Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

**Challenge:** Companies regularly exchange confidential information and need standardized, easily verifiable NDAs.

**Solution:** DaoSign can streamline the NDA process with:

- Template-based NDA creation with customizable fields
- Blockchain verification of signing and timestamps
- Easy verification of NDA status without contacting legal departments
- Automatic expiration handling based on predefined timeframes

## Identity and Credentials

### Verified Credentials

**Challenge:** Organizations need to issue and verify credentials without relying on centralized systems.

**Solution:** DaoSign enables the issuance and verification of credentials with:

- Tamper-proof credential issuance as attestations
- Self-sovereign identity integration
- Verifiable credential checks using signatory policies
- Revocation capabilities for expired or invalid credentials

**Example Implementation:**
```javascript
// Creating a credential verification schema
const credentialSchema = {
  metadata: {
    name: "Professional Certification",
    description: "Verified professional qualification",
    attestation_type: "certification",
    is_nft: true,
    is_public: false,
    is_revokable: true,
    expire_in: 31536000, // 1 year validity
    nft_name: "Professional Cert",
    nft_symbol: "CERT"
  },
  schema_definition: [
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Recipient Name" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Certification Type" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Issuing Authority" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Certification ID" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Issue Date" },
    { definition_type: "uint256", definition_name: "Valid Until" },
    { definition_type: "string", definition_name: "Verification URL" }
  ],
  signatory_policy: []
};
```

## Implementation Recommendations

When implementing DaoSign for these use cases, consider the following recommendations:

### 1. Start with Simple Schemas

Begin with straightforward document templates and gradually increase complexity as users become familiar with the system.

### 2. Define Clear Signature Policies

Carefully define who can sign different document types and what prerequisites might be required through signatory policies.

### 3. Consider Privacy Implications

For sensitive documents, carefully consider what data should be included in on-chain attestations versus referenced off-chain.

### 4. Create a User-Friendly Interface

Develop intuitive interfaces that abstract blockchain complexity while highlighting the benefits of verifiable documents.

### 5. Build Interoperability

Design schemas with interoperability in mind so that attestations can be used across different systems and workflows.

### 6. Implement Proper Authorization

Use signatory policies to ensure only authorized individuals can create, sign, or verify specific document types.

## Conclusion

DaoSign provides a flexible framework for a wide range of document signing and verification needs. By leveraging blockchain technology, it offers enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency compared to traditional document systems.

When implementing these use cases, focus on the specific requirements of your industry and users, creating schemas that balance detail, usability, and privacy considerations. Start with the most impactful workflows and gradually expand as adoption increases.
